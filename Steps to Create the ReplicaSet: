To create a ReplicaSet with the specified requirements, follow these steps:

### Steps to Create the ReplicaSet:

1. **Create a YAML configuration file for the ReplicaSet**:
   
   You will first need to define the ReplicaSet in a YAML file, which describes the `httpd-replicaset`. This YAML file will include the `httpd` container with the specified properties such as the image, labels, replica count, and container name.

   Hereâ€™s an example YAML file (`httpd-replicaset.yaml`) you can create:

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: apps/v1
   kind: ReplicaSet
   metadata:
     name: httpd-replicaset
     labels:
       app: httpd_app
       type: front-end
   spec:
     replicas: 4
     selector:
       matchLabels:
         app: httpd_app
     template:
       metadata:
         labels:
           app: httpd_app
           type: front-end
       spec:
         containers:
         - name: httpd-container
           image: httpd:latest
           ports:
           - containerPort: 80
   ```

   ### Breakdown of the YAML:
   - **apiVersion**: The API version being used for the ReplicaSet (`apps/v1`).
   - **kind**: Specifies that this is a `ReplicaSet`.
   - **metadata**:
     - **name**: The name of the ReplicaSet is `httpd-replicaset`.
     - **labels**: The labels `app: httpd_app` and `type: front-end` are applied to the ReplicaSet.
   - **spec**:
     - **replicas**: Set the replica count to 4.
     - **selector**: Matches pods with the label `app: httpd_app`.
     - **template**:
       - **metadata**: Includes the same labels (`app: httpd_app` and `type: front-end`) for the pod template.
       - **spec**:
         - **containers**: Defines the container `httpd-container` with the image `httpd:latest` and exposes port `80`.

2. **Create the ReplicaSet using `kubectl`**:

   Once the YAML file (`httpd-replicaset.yaml`) is ready, apply it using the following command:

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f httpd-replicaset.yaml
   ```

   This will create the ReplicaSet and the associated pods based on the provided specifications.

3. **Verify the ReplicaSet creation**:

   After applying the YAML file, verify that the ReplicaSet was successfully created by using the following command:

   ```bash
   kubectl get replicasets
   ```

   The output should show the `httpd-replicaset` with 4 replicas:

   ```
   NAME               DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   AGE
   httpd-replicaset   4         4         4       1m
   ```

4. **Verify the created pods**:

   To ensure the ReplicaSet has created 4 pods, check the pod status:

   ```bash
   kubectl get pods
   ```

   You should see 4 pods created with names starting with `httpd-replicaset`:

   ```
   NAME                               READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
   httpd-replicaset-xxxxx-yyyyyy      1/1     Running   0          1m
   httpd-replicaset-xxxxx-zzzzzz      1/1     Running   0          1m
   httpd-replicaset-xxxxx-aaaaaa      1/1     Running   0          1m
   httpd-replicaset-xxxxx-bbbbbb      1/1     Running   0          1m
   ```

   Each pod will have the container `httpd-container` with the image `httpd:latest`.

5. **(Optional) Describe the ReplicaSet**:

   If you want to see more detailed information about the ReplicaSet, you can describe it:

   ```bash
   kubectl describe replicasets httpd-replicaset
   ```

   This command will show detailed information about the ReplicaSet, including its pod template, labels, selectors, and current state.

### Summary of Commands:

1. **Create the ReplicaSet YAML file** (`httpd-replicaset.yaml`).
   
2. **Apply the YAML file to create the ReplicaSet**:
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f httpd-replicaset.yaml
   ```

3. **Verify the ReplicaSet creation**:
   ```bash
   kubectl get replicasets
   ```

4. **Verify that the correct number of pods are created**:
   ```bash
   kubectl get pods
   ```

5. **(Optional) Describe the ReplicaSet for more details**:
   ```bash
   kubectl describe replicasets httpd-replicaset
   ```

By following these steps, you will have successfully created a ReplicaSet named `httpd-replicaset` with the `httpd:latest` image, a replica count of 4, and the specified labels and container name.
