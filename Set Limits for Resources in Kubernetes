Set Limits for Resources in Kubernetes
The Nautilus DevOps team has noticed performance issues in some Kubernetes-hosted applications due to resource constraints. To address this, they plan to set limits on resource utilization. Here are the details:


Create a pod named httpd-pod with a container named httpd-container. Use the httpd image with the latest tag (specify as httpd:latest). Set the following resource limits:

Requests: Memory: 15Mi, CPU: 100m

Limits: Memory: 20Mi, CPU: 100m"
  ----------------------------------------
  at first createa a yaml file named "limit.yaml" in the /tmp/ folder, add all the given parameters in the yaml file
eg: 
$ nano /tmp/limit.yaml
-----------------
  apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: httpd-pod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: httpd-container
      image: httpd:latest
      resources:
        requests:
          memory: "15Mi"
          cpu: "100m"
        limits:
          memory: "20Mi"
          cpu: "100m"
--------------------------------------
To create the pod with the specified resource limits, run the following kubectl command to apply the configuration from the limit.yaml file:

$ kubectl apply -f /tmp/limit.yaml
------------------------------------------
  Once the pod is applied, check if the pod is running properly:

$ kubectl describe pod httpd-pod


-------------------------------------
